# Developer Documentation

Welcome! This folder is the entry point for anyone touching the codebase. Start here:

- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** — high-level system, module map, build & test pipeline, performance posture.
- **[IPC Contracts](./ipc.md)** — request/response schema, events, error contracts, versioning, and how to add a new command.
- **[Virtualization Patterns](./virtualization.md)** — scalable tree rendering for ~25k nodes, windowing/overscan, immutability, performance knobs.
- **[Svelte Runes Guidelines](./svelte-runes-guidelines.md)** — how we structure component state/effects with Svelte (v5 runes friendly; v4 fallback).

For CI budgets see **[ci-budgets.md](./ci-budgets.md)**.
